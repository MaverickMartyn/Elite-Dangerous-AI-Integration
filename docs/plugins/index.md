# Plugins

COVAS:NEXT offers an extensive plugin API, which allows 3rd parties to extend the functionality of your assistant, integrating it with various other tools, or just adding additional features.

# Plugin installation
All plugins are installed in the `resources/plugins` folder, found inside your COVAS:NEXT folder.  
To install a plugin, download the packaged plugin archive and extract it to a subfolder inside the `plugins` directory.  
Ensure that the manifest is found at `C:/PATH/TO/COVAS/resources/plugins/SUB-FOLDER/manifest.json`, otherwise the plugin will not load.

# For developers
See the [Development](./Development.md) page.
